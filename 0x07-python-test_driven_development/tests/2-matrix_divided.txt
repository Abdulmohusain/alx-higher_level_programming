Test for type and zero division TypeError

    >>> matrix = [
    ... [1, 2, 3],
    ... [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]

    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    >>> matrix_divided("mat", 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = [
    ... [1, [3], 3],
